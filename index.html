      <div class="row row1">
        <div class="col-md-3 col1">
          <h3 class="answer-showing">JavaScript (JS)</h3>
          <p class="answer-hidden">An object-oriented computer programming language commonly used to create interactive effects within web browsers.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-3 col2">
          <h3 class="answer-showing">Operators</h3>
          <p class="answer-hidden">Operators in JavaScript are very similar to operators that appear in other programming languages. The definition of an operator is a symbol that is used to perform an operation. Most often these operations are arithmetic (addition, subtraction, etc), but not always.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-3 col3">
          <h3 class="answer-showing">Variables</h3>
          <p class="answer-hidden">Variables can be thought of as named containers. You can place data into these containers and then refer to the data simply by naming the container. Before you use a variable in a JavaScript program, you must declare it. Variables are declared with the var keyword as follows.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-3 col4">
          <h3 class="answer-showing">Variable Naming Conventions</h3>
          <p class="answer-hidden">Use camelCase. All variables start with a letter. Specific and intelligible</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="row row2">
        <div class="col-md-3 col1">
          <h3 class="answer-showing">Functions</h3>
          <p class="answer-hidden">The function statement declares a function. A declared function is "saved for later use", and will be executed later, when it is invoked (called). In JavaScript, functions are objects, and they have both properties and methods. A function can also be defined using an expression.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-3 col2">
          <h3 class="answer-showing">Methods</h3>
          <p class="answer-hidden">JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects. A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-3 col3">
          <h3 class="answer-showing">Arguments</h3>
          <p class="answer-hidden">JavaScript functions have a built-in object called the arguments object. The argument object contains an array of the arguments used when the function was called (invoked).</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-3 col4">
          <h3 class="answer-showing">Parameters</h3>
          <p class="answer-hidden">Parameters are variables listed as a part of the function definition. Arguments are values passed to the function when it is invoked.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

        <div class="row row3">
          <div class="col-md-3 col1">
            <h3 class="answer-showing">Return</h3>
            <p class="answer-hidden">When a return statement is used in a function body, the execution of the function is stopped. If specified, a given value is returned to the function caller.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-3 col2">
            <h3 class="answer-showing">Chaining Methods</h3>
            <p class="answer-hidden">Chaining Methods, also known as Cascading, refers to repeatedly calling one method after another on an object, in one continuous line of code. This technique abounds in jQuery and other JavaScript libraries and it is even common in some JavaScript native methods.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-3 col3">
            <h3 class="answer-showing">Strings</h3>
            <p class="answer-hidden">A JavaScript string stores a series of characters like "John Doe". A string can be any text inside double or single quotes: var carname = "Volvo XC60"; var carname = 'Volvo XC60'; String indexes are zero-based: The first character is in position 0, the second in 1, and so on.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-3 col4">
            <h3 class="answer-showing">Booleans</h3>
            <p class="answer-hidden">The Boolean object represents two values, either "true" or "false".</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <div class="row row4">
          <div class="col-md-3 col1">
            <h3 class="answer-showing">Undefined</h3>
            <p class="answer-hidden">Undefined is a primitive value used when a variable has not been assigned a value. Simply saying, when you create a variable and leave it without assigning a value to it, JavaScript will automatically assign a value called undefined.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-3 col2">
            <h3 class="answer-showing">NaN</h3>
            <p class="answer-hidden">Not a Number</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-3 col3">
            <h3 class="answer-showing">Alert</h3>
            <p class="answer-hidden">The alert() method displays an alert box with a specified message and an OK button. An alert box is often used if you want to make sure information comes through to the user.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-3 col4">
            <h3 class="answer-showing">Comments</h3>
            <p class="answer-hidden">Single line comments start with //. Any text between // and the end of the line will be ignored by JavaScript (will not be executed).</p>
          </div>

            <h3 class="answer-showing">jQuery</h3>
            <p class="answer-hidden">jQuery is a JS framework that makes it much easier to use JS on your website.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-md-3 col3">
            <h3 class="answer-showing">Attributes</h3>
            <p class="answer-hidden">In HTML language, tags may have attributes. When the browser reads HTML text and creates DOM objects for tags, it recognizes standard attributes and creates DOM properties from them.</p>
